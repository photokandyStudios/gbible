    <h2>How to use the Greek Interlinear Bible</h2>
    <p>While this application was designed to be easy to use and intuitive, sometimes it helps to have instructions
       for various features, especially for those features you may not use very often. With that in mind, here's a 
       mini-manual for the Greek Interlinear Bible application.</p>
    <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
    <a name="Navigation"></a>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <p>Navigating the Bible is made very easy by two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is the left-hand
       navigation bar, which you can make visible by tapping the <button><img src="./List@2x.png"></button> button,
       which will display a list of Bible Books that you can choose from, your highlights, your annotations, or
       your most recent history, based on the selection at the top of the left-hand navigation bar.</p>
    <p>To go directly to a Bible reference, press <button>Goto</button> at the top, and then select the book from the
       list below. Once you select a book, you'll be presented with a list of chapters in that book. Select a chapter
       from the list, and you'll be presented with a list of verses in that chapter. Tap on the verse you want to go
       to and after the left-hand navigation bar closes, you'll be taken to that spot in the Bible.
    <p>If you want to go to one of your highlights, press <button>Highlights</button> instead, and then select the
       reference from the list. To help your memory, the references are colored with the highlight color you used when
       you created them. Once you tap a reference, you'll be taken to that spot in the Bible.
    <p>If you want to go to one of your annotations, press <button>Notes</button> instead. Then select one of your
       notes from the list. As a memory aide, a portion of your note is displayed in the list. Once you tap a note,
       you'll be taken to that particular spot in the Bible.
    <p>If you want to go to a place you've been recently, press <button>History</button>. You'll see a list of all
       the references you've been to lately (up to 200). Tap a reference and you'll be taken to that spot in the Bible.
    <p>While you are reading and come to the end of a particular chapter, you don't want to have to open up the left-
       hand navigation bar and select a new reference just to continue reading. Therefore, you can just swipe left
       or right with your finger to change pages, just like typical book reader. Swipe to the <b>left</b> to go forward one
       chapter, and swipe to the <b>right</b> to go back one chapter.
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> You can display the left-hand navigation bar by swiping right from the left edge of the screen. To
       close it again, just swipe left anywhere to the right of the navigation bar.
    </blockquote>
    <p>To switch between the various modes (Bible, Search, Strong's Lookup, About, and Settings), just tap the
       corresponding icon at the bottom of your screen.</p>
       
     <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
   
    <a name="Copy">
    <h3>Copy a Verse to the Clipboard</h3>
    <p>There may be times when you want to take a verse (or more) and use it in another app or send it to someone
       via email or some other social tool. All you have to do is tap on the verse(s) you wish to copy, and then
       tap-and-hold with your finger anywhere within the selection. A menu will appear, and <button>Copy</button>
       is the first item on that menu. Tap it, and the verse (along with any notes) will be copied to your clipboard.
       You can then go to your other application and paste the contents of your clipboard.
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> When you copy one or more verses, both the Greek and English come along for the ride. If your
       selected Greek edition has the Strong's Numbers and Morphology Parsings, those will also come along. Any notes
       that you've attached to the verse(s) will also be included.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> You can only copy verses within a single chapter &mdash; that is, you can't select some verses,
       move to the next chapter, and select some more and have the entire selection be copied. Only the verses within
       the visible chapter will be copied.
    </blockquote>
       <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
 
    <a name="Notes">
    <h3>Create, Edit, and Manage Annotations</h3>
    <p>When studying the Word, there will often be times when you wish to make notes or annotations about the
       text you are reading. Doing that is really easy. To create a note (or view/edit a previously created note), just 
       tap-and-hold anywhere within the verse you want to annotate, and a menu will appear. Tap <button>Annotate</button>
       and a note-entry screen will be displayed.
    <p>The first text field is the <i>title</i> of the annotation, and is set to the passage reference by default. This allows
       notes to act as good bookmarks if you don't want to change the title. If, however, you want the title to reflect
       something about the note, you can tap in the text field and change the title to whatever you wish.
    <p>The rest of the note-entry screen is for your note. Just tap anywhere inside it to start editing it. By default
       it is filled in with the Greek and English verse, just in case there are portions you wanted to reference. You
       can clear it out entirely if you wish only to create a bookmark, or you can enter any text you want. There is
       not really any limit on the length of the note, though practically these will only tend to be a few paragraphs long.
    <p>While editing a note, the two buttons at the top of the note-entry screen are <button>Cancel</button> and <button>Done</button>.
       You can tap <button>Cancel</button> to undo any editing you may have done, or you can tap <button>Done</button> to save
       your work.
    <p>If you are viewing a previously created note, and have not yet started to edit it, you can also delete the note
       by tapping <button>Delete</button>. If you just want to close the note, tap <button>Done</button>.
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> Notes, by default, are presented in-line with the Biblical text. If you want to turn this off,
       uncheck the "Show Inline Notes?" item in the <b>Settings</b> tab.
    </blockquote>
        <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

    <a name="Highlights">
    <h3>Create and Manage Highglights</h3>
    <p>There may be occasions where you will want to highlight a particular verse (or series of verses) for some
       reason. You can do this easily by first tapping the verses you want to highlight, and then tap-and-hold until
       the menu appears. Tap <button>Highlight</button>, and a new menu will appear.
    <p>This new menu has two options: <button>Add Highlight</button> and <button>Remove</button>. The first will
       add a highlight to the selected verses, while the latter will remove any existing highlight from the same
       selected verses.
    <p>If you want to change the color, tap the colored indicator next to the <button><img src="./List@2x.png"></button>
       button. A list of colors will appear: Yellow, Green, Magenta, Blue, and Pink. Tap any one of those colors
       and the color of the indicator will change. The next time you highlight a verse, it will use the color you 
       chose.
    <p>You can have as many highlights as you'd like. There is no enforced limit.</p>
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> If your device is running on iOS 4.3, you will instead see a button with the <i>name</i> of a color.
       When you tap it, the same list of colors will appear, but when you select a color, the button will change to 
       the name of the color you chose.
    </blockquote>
    
        <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<a name="Search">
    <h3>Searching the Bible and the Strong's Dictionary</h3>
    <p>Searching is a critical component when studying the Word. As such there are several different ways you can
    search both the Bible and the Strong's Dictionary. 
    <p>The first method involves coming across a word you want to know more about while reading the Bible. You can 
       tap-and-hold on the word in question, and you should notice that the word will be highlighted for a brief 
       moment. The menu will also appear with a <button>Search</button> item. Tap it and you'll be presented with
       another menu containing <button>Search Bible</button> and <button>Search Strong's</button>.
    <p>If you select <button>Search Bible</button>, you'll be taken to the <b>Search</b> tab, and the search will
       be initiated. If it is a long search, you may see an indicator on-screen &mdash; this is normal and will go
       away when the search is finished.
    <p>The same thing will occur when you select <button>Search Strong's</button>, only you'll be taken to the 
       <b>Strong's Lookup</b> tab.
    <blockquote>
      <b>Note:</b> If you have turned Greek transliteration, searching may take several moments. For faster
      searches, disable transliteration.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Once the search is complete, a list of results will appear. You can then tap on that result. If you are
       searching the Bible, you'll go to that particular verse. If you are searching the Strong's Dictionary, you'll
       be presented with a new search containing all the verses where that particular Strong's Number was found.
    <p>The second method involves going to the <b>Search</b> or <b>Strong's Lookup</b> tab directly. Once there you 
       can tap on the search field to enter your desired search term(s). Press "Search" on the on-screen keyboard to 
       start the search.
    <p>When searching using this method, you can get pretty complicated with your search terms. Here's a quick rundown
       of how you can use various operators to change the search meaning:
    <ul>
     <li>"Jesus Christ" &mdash; All verses containing the phrase "Jesus Christ" (Can't be used with any other search method.)</li>
     <li>Jesus Christ &mdash; All verses containing either the word "Jesus" or the word "Christ"</li>
     <li>Jesus +Christ &mdash; All verses containing both the words "Jesus" and "Christ"</li>
     <li>Jesus -Christ &mdash; All verses containing the word "Jesus", but NOT the word "Christ"</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
       <b>Tip:</b> If you find typing the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> too difficult, you can substitute a period (<b>.</b>)
       for the <b>+</b>, and an exclamation point (<b>!</b>) for the <b>-</b>.
    </blockquote>
    <p>When searching Greek and English, case is disregarded. Therefore you can search for "abraham" and the result will return verses with "Abraham". Also, when searching for Greek words, you aren't required to type in all the diacritical marks.
        <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

    <a name="Define">
    <h3>Defining a Word</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you'll come across a word you aren't familiar with. When you do, you can tap-and-hold on the word
       until the menu appears. Then tap on <button>Define</button> to receive a definition of that word.
    <blockquote>
       <b>Note:</b> If you tap-and-hold a Strong's Number, you may notice <button>Define</button> on the menu. This
       is just a shortcut to tapping <button>Search</button> and <button>Search Strong's</button>.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
       <b>Tip:</b> If you don't see <button>Define</button> on the menu, it means that you're probably tapping and
       holding on a Greek word. Definitions are supported only for English words and for Strong's Numbers.
    </blockquote>
        <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

    <a name="Explain">
    <h3>Explaining a Verse with a Commentary</h3>
    <p>There will be times, no doubt, when you will wish to consult a commentary about the particular verse you 
       are reading. To do this, just tap-and-hold anywhere in the verse, and the menu will appear. If you are 
       connected to the Internet you should see <button>Explain</button> on the menu. Tap this, and a web browser
       will open that takes you to a site run by Biblos.com (specifically, http://bible.cc) where a lot of 
       different versions of the verse are displayed. If you scroll down a distance, you'll come across the
       Parallel Comentaries. These often provide valuable insight to the verse you are studying.
    <p>When you are finished reading, just tap <button>Done</button>.
        <p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
      
    <a name="Settings">
    <h3>Settings</h3>
    <p>You can change the text layout, Greek and English text, import and export, and more by navigationg to the
       Settings area. Just tap "Settings" in the tab bar.
    <ul><li>Text Settings</li>
        <ul><li>Greek Text &mdash; Select from four Greek texts. The Westcott-Hort text provides diacritical markings
                along with in-line English translations of the words as well as morphology and Strong's numbers in-line.
                The Byzantine and Textus-Receptus texts provide
                only in-line morphology and Strong's numbers; the Greek is unaccented. Finally, the Tischendorf text does
                not include any morphology or Strong's numbers; it is unparsed and unaccented.</li>
            <li>English Text &mdash; Select either the Young's Literal Translation or the Authorized (King James)
                version. (Keep in mind that the Strong's numbers are indexed to the Authorized Version.)</li>
            <li>Transliterate Greek? &mdash; If Yes, the Greek letterforms will be transliterated. Note that this can
                considerably slow the app down, especially when searching. Also note that transliterations do not reflect
                any diacritics in the text.</li>
            <li>Show Morphology? &mdash; If Yes, the morphology is indicated below the Greek word.</li>
            <li>Show Strongs? &mdash; If Yes, the Strong's # is indicated below the Greek word.</li>
            <li>Show Translation? &mdash; If Yes and the text supports it, the English translation is indicated below the
                Greek word. (Only supported on Westcott-Hort.)</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <ul><li>Theme &mdash; Select from one of several color themes. Takes effect immediately.</li>
            <li>English/Greek Typeface &mdash; Select one of several typefaces. The typefaces are all polytonic, with the
                exception of the OpenDyslexic font. The OpenDyslexic font should probably be reserved for use as the
                Greek Typeface when transliterating the Greek.</li>
            <li>Font Size &mdash; Select the size of the displayed text. Smaller values will allow more text to be
                displayed at the cost of legibility. For vision-impaired individuals, larger values may help.</li>
            <li>Line Spacing &mdash; Select the distance between lines. Only visible when displaying Morphology,
                Strongs, and/or the Translation.</li>
            <li>Row Spacing &mdash; Select the distance between rows.</li>
            <li>Column Widths &mdash; Select from three colum widths. You can choose to have the Greek take up the
                majority of the screen, the English take up the majority of the screen, or have both take up equal
                screen estate.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Export</li>
        <ul><li>Export &mdash; Tap to export all your annotations and highlights to iTunes so that you can connect your
                device to your computer and copy the exported file to a safe place. This file can be used as a backup or
                as an import source for another device.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Import</li>
        <ul><li>Import Annotations &mdash; Tap to import the annotations from the import file. This file must have been
                copied from your computer to your device using iTunes, and have been previously exported from the app.</li>
            <li>Import Highlights &mdash; Tap to import the highlights from the import file.</li>
            <li>Import Everything &mdash; Tap to import everything in the import file. This is used most often to

<h4>Greek NT: Byzantine/Majority Text (2000)</h4>
<p>The Greek New Testament according to the Byzantine Textform, edited by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont, 2000 edition This is the edition by Pierpont and Robinson of a Majority, or Byzantine, text of the NT. It is similar to an earlier production of Hodges and Farstad in being based on von Soden's apparatus, but without their stemmatic reconstruction of the Apocalypse and the Pericope Adulterae.

<h4>Greek NT: Tischendorf 8th Ed.</h4>
<p>The Greek Text corresponds to the printed text found in:

<p>Tischendorf, Constantinus, Novum Testamentum Graece, editio octava critica major Vol. I, 1869; Vol. II 1872, Leipzig:Giesecke and Devrient. Vol 3, Prolegomena, ed. by Caspar Rene' Gregory, Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1894.

<p>The text contains no accents or diacritical marks.

<p>This text was prepared from the Westcott-Hort-Nestle Aland text found in the Greek text prepared by Dr. Maurice Robinson. The text was compared to the printed edition of Tischendorf's. Changes were made in the text to make it correspond to the printed edition. The text was proofed against the Tischendorf text.

<p>According to J. Harold Greenlee "His 'eighth major edition' (1869-72) contains a critical apparatus which has never been equaled in comprehensiveness of citation of Greek mss., versions, and patristic evidence. A century later it is still indispensable for serious work in the text of the N.T."

<p>The Greek text is released as a public domain text.

<p>If any errors are found in this text please let me know as soon as possible.

        AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
        PROHIBITED.</p>

        <p>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU
        ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.
        TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A
        CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
        IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
        CONDITIONS.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Definitions</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li><strong>"Adaptation"</strong> means a work based upon
          the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
          such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
          arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary
          or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
          includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in
          which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
          including in any form recognizably derived from the
          original, except that a work that constitutes a
          Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the
          purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt,
          where the Work is a musical work, performance or
          phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
          considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
          License.</li>

          <li><strong>"Collection"</strong> means a collection of
          literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
          anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
          or other works or subject matter other than works listed
          in Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection
          and arrangement of their contents, constitute
          intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in
          its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
          other contributions, each constituting separate and
          independent works in themselves, which together are
          assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
          Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
          License.</li>

          <li><strong>"Distribute"</strong> means to make available
          to the public the original and copies of the Work or
          Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
          transfer of ownership.</li>

          <li><strong>"License Elements"</strong> means the
          following high-level license attributes as selected by

          publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a
          performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
          other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
          interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works
          or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
          phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
          who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other
          sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
          organization that transmits the broadcast.</li>

          <li><strong>"Work"</strong> means the literary and/or
          artistic work offered under the terms of this License
          including without limitation any production in the

          work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
          performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
          literary or artistic work.</li>

          <li><strong>"You"</strong> means an individual or entity
          exercising rights under this License who has not
          previously violated the terms of this License with

          performances; to make available to the public Works in
          such a way that members of the public may access these
          Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by
          them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or

          protected performance or phonogram in digital form or

        </ol>

        <p><strong>2. Fair Dealing Rights.</strong> Nothing in this
        License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses
        free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
        exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
        copyright protection under copyright law or other
        applicable laws.</p>

        <p><strong>3. License Grant.</strong> Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
        a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
        the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
        exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:</p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
          one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
          incorporated in the Collections;</li>

          <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
          such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
          takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
          otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
          Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
          original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
          a modification could indicate "The original work has been
          modified.";</li>

          <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
          as incorporated in Collections; and,</li>

          <li>to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
        rights include the right to make such modifications as are
        technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
        and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
        expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
        including but not limited to the rights described in
        Section 4(e).</p>

        <p><strong>4. Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:</p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
          on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
          the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that
          restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You
          to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
          the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to
          the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
          not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
          must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
          requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from
          any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
          from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
          4(d), as requested.</li>

          <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation
          only under: (i) the terms of this License; (ii) a later
          version of this License with the same License Elements as
          this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
          license (either this or a later license version) that
          contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
          Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable
          License"). You must include a copy of, or the URI, for
          Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
          impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
          terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the
          recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
          granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that
          refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
          warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
          Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
          not impose any effective technological measures on the
          Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of
          the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to
          that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
          This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
          incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
          the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be
          made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>

          <li>You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
          in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
          private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
          for other copyrighted works by means of digital
          file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
          private monetary compensation, provided there is no
          payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with
          the exchange of copyrighted works.</li>

          <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or
          any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a
          request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
          intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
          reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
          the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
          applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
          and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
          a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
          attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
          means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
          of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
          practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
          be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
          for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in
          the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use
          of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation
          of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
          original Work by Original Author"). The credit required
          by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable
          manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
          Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
          appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
          credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
          credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
          without the separate, express prior written permission of
          the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties.</li>

            <p>For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

            <ol type="i">
              <li><strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License
              Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the
              right to collect royalties through any statutory or
              compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
              Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
              royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
              granted under this License;</li>

              <li><strong>Waivable Compulsory License
              Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions in which the
              right to collect royalties through any statutory or
              compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
              Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
              royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
              granted under this License if Your exercise of such
              rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise
              than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c)
              and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties
              through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme;
              and,</li>

              <li><strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The
              Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
              whether individually or, in the event that the
              Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
              administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
              society, from any exercise by You of the rights
              granted under this License that is for a purpose or
              use which is otherwise than noncommercial as
              permitted under Section 4(c).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor
          or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
          You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
          Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
          take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
          which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor
          or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
          jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the
          right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right
          to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
          mutilation, modification or other derogatory action
          prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
          reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
          appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
          permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
          to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of
          this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
          otherwise.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>5. Representations, Warranties and
        Disclaimer</strong></p>

        <p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN
        WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO
        REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE
        WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
        WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
        ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
        PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Limitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO
        THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
        LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
        EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Termination</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
          terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
          terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
          received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
          License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
          provided such individuals or entities remain in full
          compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
          and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</li>

          <li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
          license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
          the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
          the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
          Work under different license terms or to stop
          distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
          any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
          (or any other license that has been, or is required to
          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
          License will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p>

        <ol type="a">
          <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
          license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
          the license granted to You under this License.</li>

          <li>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
          Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
          the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
          license granted to You under this License.</li>

          <li>If any provision of this License is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.</li>

          <li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
          waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
          consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged with such waiver or consent.</li>

          <li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between
          the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
          not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
          in any communication from You. This License may not be
          modified without the mutual written agreement of the
          Licensor and You.</li>

          <li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter
          referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the
          terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of
          Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
          1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
          Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
          Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as
          revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
          matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which
          the License terms are sought to be enforced according to
          the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
          those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
          If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
          copyright law includes additional rights not granted
          under this License, such additional rights are deemed to
          be included in the License; this License is not intended
          to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
          law.</li>
